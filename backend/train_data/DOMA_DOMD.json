    "basic": "DOMA and DOMD are SAP Data Dictionary objects related to domains. They define consistent technical attributes (like data type, length, allowed values) for table fields across the system.",

      "DOMA": {
        "definition": "DOMA (Domain) defines the technical attributes of a field such as data type, field length, and the set of valid values it can hold. A domain is reused in multiple data elements and table fields to enforce consistency and reduce redundancy.",
        "purpose": [
          "Maintain consistent data types and validations across tables.",
          "Centralize control over fixed value ranges (e.g., status codes like A, B, C).",
          "Promote reusability — change once, reflect everywhere."

        "example": {
          "description": "A domain named 'ZSTATUS' might define a CHAR(1) field with values A (Active), B (Blocked), and C (Closed). This domain can be reused across tables like ZCUSTOMER, ZVENDOR, etc., wherever the same status logic is required.",

      "DOMD": {
        "definition": "DOMD is the transport object type associated with domains. When a domain is transported between systems (e.g., from DEV to QA or PROD), it's stored under object type DOMD.",
        "importance": "Understanding DOMD is crucial for retrofit activities because version comparisons and transports reference this internal name rather than the user-friendly DOMA label."

  "retrofit_process": {
    "summary": "The retrofit process for DOMA/DOMD ensures that the domain definitions are identical between source and target systems (e.g., Dev and QA). It involves comparing, identifying differences, and applying manual adjustments.",

      "Step 1: Go to SE11 in the **source system**. Locate and open the domain (DOMA) you want to retrofit.",
      "Step 2: Check the following elements:\n - Data Type\n - Length\n - Decimal Places (if numeric)\n - Value Ranges or Fixed Values\n - Description and Short Text",
      "Step 3: Open SE11 in the **target system** and navigate to the same domain.",
      "Step 4: Manually compare every field OR use TCode RSSYSCOMP for system-based version comparison (recommended).",
      "Step 5: In RSSYSCOMP:\n - Add object type DOMD\n - Enter the domain name(s)\n - Set source and target RFC destinations\n - Run the comparison",
      "Step 6: Identify mismatched domains.\nIf differences exist, apply changes manually in SE11 in the target system based on source system.",
      "Step 7: After changes are made, activate the domain in the target system.",
      "Step 8: Run the version comparison again to confirm both systems are now in sync."

    "manual": "Manual comparison is done in SE11 by visually comparing domain properties between source and target.",

  "best_practices": [
    "Always check transport logs to confirm DOMD objects are captured.",
    "Use consistent naming conventions for custom domains (e.g., Z_ or Y_ prefixes).",
    "Keep documentation of each domain's purpose and where it's used.",
    "Re-run RSSYSCOMP after each retrofit to verify synchronization.",
    "Discuss domain changes with functional consultants to avoid breaking business logic tied to value ranges."
