    },
    {
      "question": "Can REPT be safely imported in retrofit?",
      "answer": "Only if it's a new object. For existing objects, REPT should be retrofitted manually. Do not fix REPT manually for MPC and DPC classes."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I identify the original language of a REPT object?",
      "answer": "Open the object in SE38 and check if any untranslated messages appear. If not, you're in the original language. You can also refer to client-specific language settings."
    },
    {
      "question": "How to compare REPT between source and target systems?",
      "answer": "Login to the target system in original language. Use RFC connection to fetch remote version from the source and compare in SE38 > Text elements for all 3 tabs."
    },
    {
      "question": "What steps should be followed to maintain REPT in translated language?",
      "answer": "Login in secondary language, compare text elements, use Translation mode if editing is disabled, then save and activate the object."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if I see differences in Selection Text but can't edit directly?",
      "answer": "Enter translation mode via GoTo > Translations in SE38. Maintain the translation and activate the object afterwards."
    },
    {
      "question": "How is REPT retrofit status updated in the scoping sheet?",
      "answer": "Based on both language comparisons. If retrofit was done in any language, mark 'Retrofit Done'. If both are identical, mark 'No Action'. Avoid using 'primary/secondary' terms in comments."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I use RSSYSCOMP for REPT comparison?",
      "answer": "Yes, RSSYSCOMP can compare 8 objects at a time across systems, but original and secondary languages must be known beforehand."
    },
    {
      "question": "What are common issues faced during REPT retrofit?",
      "answer": "Language mismatch, edit restrictions in secondary language, absence of insert options in Selection Text, and manual handling for DPC/MPC classes."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the role of Translation Mode in REPT?",
      "answer": "Translation Mode (GoTo > Translations) allows maintaining text elements in a different language when direct editing is disabled in the secondary language."
    },
    {
      "question": "When should REPT objects not be touched manually?",
      "answer": "Never manually update REPT for MPC or DPC classes. These are generated automatically and should be handled through proper regeneration."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is it necessary to activate the object after translation?",
      "answer": "Yes, after editing or translating text elements, always activate the REPT object to reflect the changes."
