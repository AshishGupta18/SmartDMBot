    "overview": "TABL, TABD, and TABT are SAP object types related to database tables and their metadata:\n- TABL: Represents the structure of a database table, including fields, data types, key fields, and foreign keys.\n- TABD: Refers to the delivery class and data class configurations that determine how table data is handled during transports.\n- TABT: Contains the technical settings of the table, such as buffering options, data class, logging, and size category.",
    "usage": "These objects are managed using transaction SE11 (ABAP Dictionary). During dual maintenance, developers must ensure these tables are consistent across development and retrofit systems to maintain data model integrity.",

      "RSSYSCOMP": "Used to compare up to 8 SAP objects (e.g., TABL, TABD, TABT) simultaneously across systems using RFC.",

      "question": "How can I retrofit TABL/TABD/TABT?",

      "question": "How do I check technical settings of a table?",
      "answer": "In SE11, open the table, then go to 'Technical Settings' to view and compare options like buffering, data class, and logging."

      "question": "What is the use of RSSYSCOMP?",
      "answer": "RSSYSCOMP allows comparison of up to 8 objects at once using RFC. It's helpful for quickly identifying differences between systems."
