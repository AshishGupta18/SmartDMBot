        "What are the components of IWPR?": "The main components include Data Model (Entity Types, Entity Sets, Associations, Complex Types), Service Implementation (DPC/MPC classes), Runtime Artifacts, and Service Maintenance.",
        "What to check during IWPR retrofit?": "Verify existence using SEGW, check version info using SE03, compare data model subcomponents (except model references), regenerate project after copying source changes, and ensure DPC/MPC methods are not manually changed.",
        "How to handle errors during IWPR generation?": "If you get ABAP field-related errors, ensure the structure used in the entity type is also retrofitted. Then regenerate the project.",
        "What are the supporting object types for IWPR?": "IWSV, IWMO, IWOM, and IWSG are supporting object types. Only NEW entries should be imported via ToC.",
        "How to compare changes during IWPR retrofit?": "Use SEGW to open the project in source and target, copy ALVs and compare using Meld or WinMerge. Do this for Entity Types, Complex Types, Associations, and Entity Sets.",
        "Why is original language important in IWPR?": "Because labels entered will only reflect in the REPT if the original language is used."
